# FileFinder
Java app that runs in console. User will search for a file and the app will return whether the target is a: file, directory, or non-existent. If the target is a directory, an option to list the files is possible.

# Motivation
I wanted to bulid an app that would run in the console rather than having a GUI. Buliding a simple file finder gave me 
the exact opportunity to achieve what I wanted to do.

# How to Run
#### Windows
Using the command line, type " java -jar 'FileFinder.jar'" to run.

to exit, type "exit" whenever.

# Functionality
FileFinder prompts the user for a file path. FileFinder will figure out if the target file is existent. If the file is existent, it will figure out if the target is a file or a directory. If it is a file, it will list the file's path. If it is a directory, FileFinder will ask if the user would like to list all files within the directory. 

FileFinder runs continously after running once.
